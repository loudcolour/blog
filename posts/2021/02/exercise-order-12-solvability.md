Let $G$ be a group and its order be $56$. Then, $G$ is solvable.
$56 = 2^3\cdot 7$, and there exists two possibilities on the number of
7-Sylow subgroup: 1 and 8. If there exists only one 7-Sylow subgroup $P_7$,
i.e. $P_7 \vartriangleleft G$, $P_7$ and $G/P_7$ is 7-group and 2-group respectively,
thus $G$ is solvable by Lemma~\ref{LEM: 1}.

If there exist 8 7-Sylow subgroups of $G$, there are 48 elements of $G$
whose order is 7. (Let us say $P_7$ and $P_7'$ are not identical and both
7-Sylow subgroups.  If $x\in P_7 \cap P_7'$ and $x \neq 1$, $P_7 = \langle x \rangle = P_7'$.
By contradiction, $P_7 \cap P_7'$ is trivial.) Thus
there exist at most 8 elements whose order is 1, 2, 4, or 8 on $G$.
This implies there is only one 2-Sylow subgroup $P_2$ i.e. $P_2 \vartriangleleft G$,
and thus $G$ is solvable as same as the case of $P_7 \vartriangleleft G$.
